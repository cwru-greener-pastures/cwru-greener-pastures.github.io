# CWRU Greener Pastures Project

This is the website/repository for code and tools that accompany the Greener Pastures project, a collaborative effort between Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and Virginia Tech. This project aims to develop an autonomous robot for manure management in pastures, with the goal of reducing environmental water contamination.

## Project Goals

* Develop CPS algorithms and control for automated manure mitigation.
* Create robot navigation methods for co-livestock autonomy in pasture maintenance.
* Develop, implement, and assess an autonomous robot for automated manure mitigation.
* Dissemination, Education, and Outreach.

## Progress and Accomplishments

* PSR1 Development: An existing robot platform (PSR1) has been updated with sensors and algorithms for data collection in pastures, including animal behavior data.
* PSR2 Development: A John Deere 1025R sub-compact tractor is being automated (PSR2) with sensors, actuators, and an onboard computer. Progress has been made in teleoperation and autonomous control development.
* Manure Collection Mechanism: A mechanism for collecting manure has been developed and tested.
* Data Collection: Data has been collected on robot locomotion, animal behavior, and animal heart rate during robot interaction.
* Software Development: Algorithms for robot locomotion, navigation, and manure loading are being developed.
* Simulation Environment: A geo-referenced simulation environment has been created and released on GitHub: https://github.com/cwru-greener-pastures/tractor_simulation/
* Open Source Contributions: Fixes for a COTS ESP32 board have been released on GitHub.
* Education and Outreach: Undergraduate and graduate students have been mentored, K-12 outreach activities have been conducted, and a conference paper has been submitted.

## Future Work

* Complete the development of autonomous control algorithms for PSR2.
* Integrate animal location and behavior data into path planning.
* Conduct further data collection and analysis on animal behavior and habituation.
* Publish scholarly articles and open-source software.
* Continue K-12 and undergraduate student engagement.
